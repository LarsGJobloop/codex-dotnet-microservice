# Golang Microservice Monorepo

This repository hosts Go-based microservices. Each service is containerized with Docker and lives under the `services/` directory.

These services collectively power **FlowMesh**, an API-only automation tool with a node-based workflow editor. See [docs/FlowMesh.md](docs/FlowMesh.md) for an overview of the project and its core services.
